Investigate:
- Is the data current or outdated?
- Are historical comparisons accurate?
- Is old data being presented as new?
- Have there been recent changes that affect the claim?
- Are the time periods being compared fairly?

Look for:
- Cherry-picked time periods that misrepresent trends
- Misleading comparisons (e.g., comparing pandemic vs non-pandemic periods)
- Claims using outdated statistics
- Whether "records" or "firsts" are accurately characterized
- Seasonal variations being ignored

Search for:
- Historical data to verify comparisons
- Trend data over time
- Recent updates that might contradict older claims
- Context about why certain time periods might be anomalous

Your output should assess:
1. Whether the temporal framing is accurate
2. If time periods are being fairly compared
3. Whether the data is current
4. Any temporal context that affects interpretation
